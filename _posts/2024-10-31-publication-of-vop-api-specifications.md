The European Payments Council (EPC) published the [Verification Of Payee (VOP) Application Programming Interface (API) Specifications](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/implementation-guidelines/verification-payee-scheme-inter-psp-api-specifications) on 31 October 2024. This happened after the release of the first version of the VOP scheme rulebook earlier that month. 

The VOP API specifications focus exclusively on VOP-related messages exchanged between Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and include VOP requests and VOP responses in a standardised and interoperable manner, allowing PSPs to verify payee information before initiating a payment. The API follows a RESTful JSON format and uses ISO 20022 resource elements. 

The specifications are in line with version 1.0 of the VOP scheme rulebook and will become effective on 5 October 2025.

**What is next for the VOP scheme?**

As indicated in the EPCâ€™s announcement about the rulebook publication, the EPC plans to release additional information about achieving reachability and interoperability for the VOP scheme at the EEA level. This will include information on mandatory registration and use of the EPC Directory Service (EDS). It will also include further details about the VOP adherence process.
