The European Payments Council (EPC) published the [2025 SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) Scheme Rulebook](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/document-library/rulebooks/2025-sepa-instant-credit-transfer-rulebook-version-10) on 28 November 2024, with an effective date of **5 October 2025**. This publication marks a shift from the typical end-of-November release schedule and introduces a range of important changes, mainly driven by the Instant Payments Regulation (IPR).

**Notable Changes in the 2025 Rulebook**

The 2025 SCT Inst Rulebook introduces several noteworthy changes:

*   **Reduced Target Execution Time:** The targeted execution time for SCT Inst transactions has been **reduced from 10 seconds to 5 seconds**.
*   **Formalisation of "Time of Receipt":** The updated rulebook formally defines the "Time of Receipt" as the moment the payer (Originator) authorises the SCT Inst Instruction and the Originator PSP receives it. The Time Stamp within the SCT Inst Transaction message marks this specific point in time.
*   **Enhanced Payer Notification:** The Originator PSP must keep the payer (Originator) informed throughout the entire transaction process, including **timely updates on confirmation status** being either positive confirmations, rejections, and instances where no confirmation is received. The rulebook mandates these notifications but **allows Originator PSPs to choose their communication channels and the specific content of these notifications**. 
*   **Elimination of Maximum Amount:** The rulebook **removes any scheme-level stipulation for a maximum amount** for SCT Inst transactions. 
*   **Mandatory Verification of Payee:** Originator PSPs are **obligated to conduct a verification of payee service**, adhering to the EPC Verification Of Payee (VOP) Scheme Rulebook.
*   **Obligation to Respond to Verification Requests:** Beneficiary PSPs are now **required to respond to verification of payee requests** originating from Originator PSPs, also according to the EPC Verification Of Payee (VOP) Scheme Rulebook.
*   **Address Format Adjustments:** A hybrid address format is introduced, allowing for greater flexibility alongside the existing fully structured and unstructured formats. However, **starting 22 November 2026, only the fully structured and hybrid formats will be permitted**.
